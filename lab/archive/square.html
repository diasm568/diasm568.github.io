<p1>Square</p1>

<p2>Sans Serif Typeface</p2>
<p style="width:340px;">These designs are generally based on grotesque character traits and proportions, but have a definite and, in some instances, dramatic squaring of normally curved strokes. They usually have more latitude in character spacing than their sans serif cousins, and tend to be limited to display designs.</p>
